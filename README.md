Virtual GameBoy Manager (frontend to VGB)

A program from one of my prime years :) This is an app I wrote in the summer of 1996. As a founder and bot-runner of #emu (efnet), we rode the wave of the first generation of emulators for Game Boy and NES. At the time, GameBoy emulators were all DOS based and ran from the command line, so I decided to write a DOS-based front end to one. This was my first foray into a text-GUI environment, as well as my first time playing with memory management, and creating linked lists of files. There was also basic levels of encryption used for the codes/cheats database.
