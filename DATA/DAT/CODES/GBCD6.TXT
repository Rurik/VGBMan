WARIO LAND(tm) SUPER MARIO LAND 3(tm) GAME

Please take note: Because of the way Wario Land uses battery backup
RAM, this cart will not work on some Game Genie/Game Boy
combinations. There is nothing we can do about this. If you think you
will not enjoy the experience of trying the codes and finding that
they do not work, then please do not try. (One thing that sometimes
helps is installing fresh batteries or using an adequate power
supply.)
